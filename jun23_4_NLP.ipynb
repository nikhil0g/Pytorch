    "# Representing text\n",

    "### We understand what each letter represents, and how all characters come together to form the words of a sentence. However, computers by themselves do not have such an understanding, and a neural network has to learn the meaning during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, we can use different approaches when representing text:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character-level representation, when we represent text by treating each character as a number. Given that we have  C different characters in our text corpus, the word Hello would be represented by   5 * C tensor. Each letter would correspond to a tensor column in one-hot encoding. Word-level representation, when we create a vocabulary of all words in our text sequence or sentence(s), and then represent each word using one-hot encoding. This approach is somehow better, because each letter by itself does not have much meaning, and thus by using higher-level semantic concepts - words - we simplify the task for the neural network. However, given a large dictionary size, we need to deal with high-dimensional sparse tensors. For example, if we have a vocabulary size of 10,000 different words. Then each word would have an one-hot encoding length of 10,000; hence the high-dimensional. to unify those approaches, we typically call an atomic piece of text a token. In some cases tokens can be letters, in other cases - words, or parts of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For example, we can choose to tokenize indivisible as in-divis-ible, where the # sign represents that the token is a continuation of the previous word. This would allow the root divis to always be represented by one token, corresponding to one core meaning.The process of converting text into a sequence of tokens is called tokenization. Next, we need to assign each token to a number, which we can feed into a neural network. This is called vectorization, and is normally done by building a token vocabulary.\n",

If we represent words 'hot` and 'dog' always by the same vectors, it can confuse the model.\n",
